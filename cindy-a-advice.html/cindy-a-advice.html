                <h4>Can You Really Learn Tech?</h4>
                <p>Yes! You may surprise yourself how much you can learn in a short time.</p>

                <p>There will be times you will feel discouraged or unsure why you took something like this one - but that's all a part of learning.</p>

                <h4>Make Use of Your Resources</h4>
                <p>Reach out to the instructors. They are very approachable and knowledgeable.</p>

                <p>Of course, you can get quite far using Google or looking through Slack.</p>

                <p>You can do it!</p>
